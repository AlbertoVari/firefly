The quickest way to get started with a local FireFly stack is through the [FireFly CLI](https://github.com/kaleido-io/firefly-cli).  This will provide you with a set of 
Docker containers encapsulating the core FireFly componentry, all of which you can easily start, stop and remove from your machine with simple `ff` commands and the associated
flags.  

Once you have successfully installed and interacted with the FireFly CLI, you can extend your usage with the lightweight 
[Private Data Transfer](https://github.com/kaleido-io/firefly-samples/tree/master/private-data-transfer-cli) sample application.
